## Naming conventions for the html page

## Property values for Style Sheet.

.mainpage(classes) {
    height: 100vh;
    background-image: url()
    background-position: center;
    background-size:cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    /* padding: 10%; */
    width: 100%;
}

Problems:

There was a styling issue in the page six:
setting the width to 100% would add to the width of the page
therefore creating a blank bar on the right side of the page. 
commented out for now. -Maziar
