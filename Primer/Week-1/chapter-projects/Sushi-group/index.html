              Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with
              fish, egg, or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin
              sheet of seaweed.

              Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the
              rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans
              think of it as raw fish.
